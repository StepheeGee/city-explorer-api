**Author**: Stephanie G. Johnson
**Version**: 1.1.1

## Overview

The problem domain for this assignment involves building a React application that integrates the Axios library to facilitate user-initiated requests for data from a specific third-party API, namely the Location IQ Geocoding API. We use two key functionalities:

1. **Integration of Axios**: This involves incorporating the Axios library within a React application to handle HTTP requests effectively. It would require understanding how Axios works, making use of its methods to send requests, handle responses, and manage data retrieval from the Location IQ API.

2. **Utilizing Location IQ Geocoding API**:
   - **Search / Forward Geocoding**: Implementing functionality that allows users to perform forward geocoding, i.e., converting addresses or location names into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) using the Location IQ API.
   - **Static Maps**: Possibly creating static maps based on the obtained geographic coordinates or other location-related data retrieved from the API.

Thank you soooooo much Brandon (TA)

## Time Estimates

I didn't do a careful job of logging this yesterday and today. I can say that I thought I would complete the lab before the deadline, and I didn't. But after spending a lot of time with TA Brandon, and being the code review example in class, my lab is complete. It took me 9 hours on 12.5.23 and 4 hours today, 12.6.23.
